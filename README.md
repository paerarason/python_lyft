### Whether or not a Lyft rental car should be serviced depends on two factors at the moment:

The engine; and
The battery.
Each of the three types of engines has its own criteria for determining when it should be serviced. The same applies to each type of battery.

### The current service criteria are as follows:

### Service criteria
- Capulet Engine	Once every 30,000 miles
- Willoughby Engine	Once every 60,000 miles
- Sternman Engine	Only when the warning indicator is on
- Spindler Battery	Once every 2 years
- Nubbin Battery	Once every 4 years
- There are five car models in Lyftâ€™s fleet, each with a different engine-battery combination. These are outlined below:
